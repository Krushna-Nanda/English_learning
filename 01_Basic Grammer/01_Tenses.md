### Present Perfect Continous :

```
# Present Perfect Continuous
-----------------------------------------

Here we use the same helping verb that is used in the present perfect tense that is { has , have } buit the main verb is different here we use the present participle form of the verb that is { verb + ing } .

Summary of "Since" and "For":

"Since" ‚Äì Used to indicate a specific starting point in time (when something began).

Formula: Since + specific time/event
Examples:
"I‚Äôve been working since 9 AM."
"They have been friends since childhood."
"She has been living here since 2020."
"For" ‚Äì Used to indicate a duration (how long something has been happening).

Formula: For + length of time
Examples:
"I‚Äôve been studying for two hours."
"He has been waiting for a week."
"We have been working for years."
Key Difference:
Since = Specific starting point (time, date, event).
For = Duration of time (how long).

Formula for Present Perfect Continuous:

### Past Indefinite :

```
To convert **"Maine apna homework kiya"** into **Present Indefinite Tense**, the sentence would be:

**"Main apna homework karta hoon."** (for males)  
or  
**"Main apna homework karti hoon."** (for females)

### Explanation:
- **"Main"** = "I"
- **"karta hoon"** or **"kartii hoon"** = "do" (Present Indefinite form for males/females)
- **"apna homework"** = "my homework"

This expresses that the action of doing homework is a **habit** or something that happens regularly.
```

```
# Past Indefinite
-----------------------------------------
1. Here the helping verb that we use is { did } .

When constructing a sentence in the past tense, you typically use the second form of the verb (past form). If you're using an auxiliary verb (like was, were, did, had), the main verb returns to its base form.

Certainly! Here's a detailed explanation of the four types of **Past Indefinite Tense** sentences, with multiple examples and their corresponding Hindi sentences.

I hope this gives you a clear understanding of the **Past Continuous Tense** and how to form various types of sentences! Let me know if you need further clarification.

==================================================================

2 types of verb is there , in below exmaple , look it throughly :


Ah, I see what you're asking now. Let me clarify the use of **"called"** in the sentence **"Where were you going when I called you?"**

### Why do we use **"called"** (second form) after **"were"** (past continuous)?

In this sentence, you're dealing with **two separate actions** that happened in the past:

1. **"Where were you going?"** ‚Äì This part is in **Past Continuous** tense. It's describing an ongoing action that was happening at a specific point in the past.

2. **"When I called you"** ‚Äì This part is in **Simple Past** tense, describing a specific completed action (the call) at a definite time in the past.

Now, to answer your question:

### Why does **"called"** (second form) not follow the same rule as the first verb (i.e., "were")?

- **"Were"** is part of the **Past Continuous tense** for the verb "going." It‚Äôs only applied to the **first verb** (in this case, **"going"**) because the rule is that only the main verb is in the continuous form.
  
- **"Called"** is a **second verb** that‚Äôs in the **Simple Past** tense, not affected by the continuous structure of the first verb. We can mix **Past Continuous** with **Simple Past** when describing two different actions in the past.

### So, here's the reasoning:
When two verbs are used in a sentence, **the auxiliary verb ("was/were") applies only to the first verb** in the **Past Continuous** tense. The second verb is independent of this tense rule and can still be in the **Simple Past** tense if it's describing a distinct, completed action that happened during the ongoing action.

### Example:

- **"She was reading a book when I called her."**
   - **"Was reading"** (Past Continuous) describes an ongoing action.
   - **"Called"** (Simple Past) describes a specific, completed event.

### In summary:
- **"Were"** (or **"was"**) applies to the first verb (**"going"**) because it's in the **Past Continuous** tense.
- **"Called"** remains in the **Simple Past** tense because it represents a specific event that interrupted or happened during the ongoing action (the going).

I hope this clears up your question! Let me know if you need further explanation.

# Future Tense

   - *Shall we go for a walk?* (Suggestion)
   
In modern English, **"will"** is more commonly used for all subjects, even in place of **"shall"** in most situations. However, **"shall"** is still used for more formal speech or writing, especially with **I** and **we**..

Will" is used with both singular and plural subjects, regardless of whether the subject is in the first, second, or third person. It is the most common auxiliary verb used to form the future tense in English.

You will
He/She/It will
