### Present Perfect Continous :

```
# Present Perfect Continuous
-----------------------------------------

Here we use the same helping verb that is used in the present perfect tense that is { has , have } buit the main verb is different here we use the present participle form of the verb that is { verb + ing } .

Summary of "Since" and "For":

"Since" ‚Äì Used to indicate a specific starting point in time (when something began).

Formula: Since + specific time/event
Examples:
"I‚Äôve been working since 9 AM."
"They have been friends since childhood."
"She has been living here since 2020."
"For" ‚Äì Used to indicate a duration (how long something has been happening).

Formula: For + length of time
Examples:
"I‚Äôve been studying for two hours."
"He has been waiting for a week."
"We have been working for years."
Key Difference:
Since = Specific starting point (time, date, event).
For = Duration of time (how long).

Formula for Present Perfect Continuous:
