The **Present Perfect Continuous** and **Past Perfect Continuous** tenses both describe actions that were happening over a period of time, but they refer to different points in time. Here’s a breakdown of the differences:

### 1. **Present Perfect Continuous**  
- **Usage:** This tense describes an action that started in the past and is still continuing or has just finished, with relevance to the present.
- **Structure:**  
  **Subject + have/has + been + verb-ing**
  - **Example:** *I have been studying for two hours.* (I started studying in the past and am still studying or just finished.)

### 2. **Past Perfect Continuous**  
- **Usage:** This tense describes an action that was happening over a period of time in the past before another past event occurred. It emphasizes the duration of the action before something else happened.
- **Structure:**  
  **Subject + had + been + verb-ing**
  - **Example:** *I had been studying for two hours before you called.* (I was studying before the call happened, and it emphasizes the duration of the studying up to the point of the call.)

### Key Differences:
- **Time Reference:**  
  - **Present Perfect Continuous** relates to the **present**, showing actions that have relevance or are ongoing (or just finished).  
  - **Past Perfect Continuous** relates to a **past event** and shows an action that was happening **before another action in the past**.
  
- **Context of Action:**  
  - **Present Perfect Continuous:** Focuses on actions still affecting the present or very recent actions.  
  - **Past Perfect Continuous:** Focuses on actions that were ongoing in the past but finished before another past event.

### Examples:
- **Present Perfect Continuous:**  
  *She has been working here for five years.* (She started working here in the past and is still working here.)
  
- **Past Perfect Continuous:**  
  *She had been working here for five years before she left.* (She worked here for five years in the past, and then she left.) 

In short, the **Present Perfect Continuous** connects the past with the present, while the **Past Perfect Continuous** focuses on the period of time before another past action.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not quite. The **Past Perfect Continuous** tense is used specifically to describe actions that were ongoing in the **past** and **completed** before another **past** event happened. It does **not** carry the idea that the action continues into the present.

Here’s a clearer explanation:

### What Past Perfect Continuous Actually Means:
- **It shows an action that was happening over a period of time before another event in the past.**
- The action **has finished** in the past, but the focus is on the **duration of the action** before the past event occurred.

For example:
- **"I had been working for two hours before you called."**
  - The action of working was ongoing in the past, but it **ended before the call**.
  - The focus is on **how long** the work was happening before the call took place.

### What It Does NOT Mean:
- The **Past Perfect Continuous** does not imply that the action is still happening in the present. 
- If an action is still ongoing in the present, you would use the **Present Perfect Continuous** instead.

For example:
- **Present Perfect Continuous:** *I have been working for two hours.* (The action is still happening now.)
- **Past Perfect Continuous:** *I had been working for two hours before you called.* (The action was happening in the past but finished before the call.)

### Key Difference:
- **Past Perfect Continuous** = Action **completed in the past** but emphasizes the **duration** before another event in the past.
- **Present Perfect Continuous** = Action that started in the **past** and is still happening **now**.

So, the Past Perfect Continuous does not mean something that started in the past and is still ongoing in the present. It focuses on a completed action in the past that was ongoing before a particular past event.
